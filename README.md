This is going to be a practice sheet going over some modern CSS concepts.

We're going to learn flexbox, grid, psuedoelements, CSS Frameworks, and more!

I've been studying front-end tech for about 4 months now, this is going to be a review of concepts I've studied before and new one's I havn't hit yet.

That's it!
